# Uncertainty Quantification
*List of templates focused on uncertainty quantification applied to machine learning and deep learning*

## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black& white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured.

## Some of the topics covered in this repository are:
- Difference between prediction and confidence intervals
- Quantile regression
- Uncertainty quantification applied to ANNs
- How to estimate your model uncertainty with frameworks such as KERAS, PyTorch, XGBoost, LightGBM and ScikitLearn
